This is an (UNFINISHED) tower defense game which is Pokemon themed. Right now, the game doesn't really do a whole lot. Demo.java has main().

Enemies:
Enemies will spawn at a fixed location in fixed time intervals. If there is a fork in their path, they'll choose randomly. The only enemy right now is a RocketGrunt.
Future ideas:
Add more types of enemies with differing speads and HPs. Make it such that enemies enter in waves. Maybe some enemies fight back?

Towers:
Towers are pokemon which shoot their attacks. Right now, Charmander shoots fire. Towers have a range and frequency with which they attack.
Future ideas:
More types of towers. Upgrade towers by evolving the pokemon. Be able to buy more towers.

Attacks:
Attacks select the closest enemy within range and follow the enemy. If the enemy exits before the attack hits it, the attack will search for a new target. If no new target is in range, it will just float off the world. Right now, Ember is the only attack.
Future ideas:
Add different types of attacks. Upgrade an attack to make it more powerful or more frequent. Different types (fire, water, poison, etc) will have different effects on different enemies. 

Other (obvious) future ideas:
Have levels begin and end.
Add a point system with which upgrades can be purchased.
Add different maps.
